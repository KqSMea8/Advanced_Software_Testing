            <title>[HBASE-4926] DebugFilter; counts how many KVs skipped before result found, counts storefiles we tripped over</title>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure this possible but chatting w/ J-D after he finished helping a crew who had a slow scan, we need ways to help folks figure out why stuff is slow on the server side.  In this case, the user had a region that had gigs of deletes in it that had to be skipped before the scanner got to a value to return so scans looked slow though working &apos;correctly&apos;.  If the user could enable a DebugFilter than did counts of what Scans were skipping and size of data skipped among other things, it might help w/ the situation above &amp;#8211; and perhaps with others (What else could we count in a filter?)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about how to actually optimize the case.&lt;br/&gt;
When looking at the code in trunk I found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4585&quot; title=&quot;Avoid next operations (and instead reseek) when current kv is deleted&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-4585&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-4585&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; probably fixes this particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13445693" author="stack" created="Fri, 31 Aug 2012 05:42:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@Jesse I don&apos;t think so.  Trace would having timings as it crosses spans.  It wouldn&apos;t emit counts of how man KVs it interrogated.  A DebugFilter that dumped out kvs skipped, hfiles traversed, etc., sounds useful still.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13445711" author="jesse_yates" created="Fri, 31 Aug 2012 06:15:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@stack but wouldn&apos;t this make more sense as part of the information you get back from a regular operation? Maybe you turn on a flag in the client and it starts dumping data about scans, transparently to everything else. I could see that as the DebugFilter, but it would be nice to make that pretty much transparent to the existing operation (like the tracing is).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13445714" author="stack" created="Fri, 31 Aug 2012 06:23:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Transparent would be better than having to add a filter.  Set a flag on Scan and Get?  Hard part would be adding the info unless we did something like add it as meta on Result returned?  Should really be in envelope of the response rpc.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14735184" author="stack" created="Tue, 8 Sep 2015 17:11:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Resovling old idea not acted upon. Scan metrics does some of this. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
