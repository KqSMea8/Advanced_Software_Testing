            <title>[HBASE-2607] Update HowToContribute wiki page</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2607</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hbase wiki is currently out of date. I would like to see it updated so that new / current developers can have a single source describing the current process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the hbase dev email list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some issues that I see / things that I would like clarified include:&lt;br/&gt;
1. The use of ant - from what I understand this is no longer the case as maven has been introduced. As a result a number of the instructions are out of date.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Use of git - from what I gathered from trawling the hbase-dev list, a git repo is available. I&apos;d prefer to use this approach as I think it is a better way to work (probably a number of you agree). I&apos;d like to see a reference to the git repo here and perhaps some instructions on how to work with git in the hbase context (might help others in the future adopt git rather than svn).&lt;br/&gt;
3. The recent introduction of the use of Review Board for reviewing work. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Also made some changes for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;svn repository location (changes due to move to top level project)&lt;br/&gt;
email address changes (changes due to move to top level project)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12870645" author="stack" created="Mon, 24 May 2010 15:33:51 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I just reviewed the page.   Here&apos;s some stuff you might look into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+ Jon has started adding the label &apos;noob&apos; to issues that might be good for new devs.  You might want to make mention of this fact in here (We should all take up this practise of Jon&apos;s).&lt;br/&gt;
+ Maybe start off the coding ocnvention section w/ a general note that the new dev should not break with the convention they see in files being modified&lt;br/&gt;
+ Tests should be written using junit4 (It says junit only.. qualifiy w/ junit 4 to be clear)&lt;br/&gt;
+ These classes are now deprecated &quot;You must implement a class that extends junit.framework.TestCase, org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseTestCase or org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseClusterTestCase and whose class name starts with Test.&quot;  In junit4 no need to subclass a TestCase.  Instead new devs should be using HBaseTestingUtility.  Perhaps point them at something like TestingFromClientSide as example for how to use this utility.&lt;br/&gt;
+ They need to name the clase with a &apos;Test&apos; prefix so it&apos;ll be notice by the mvn test runner.  Point at a unit test example because as this is written &apos;Define methods within your class whose names begin with test, and call JUnit&apos;s many assert methods to verify conditions; these methods will be executed when you run mvn install.&apos;, it would seem to presume junit3 (in junit4 you use annotations but yes, even here tests should be name testOne, testTwo, etc)&lt;br/&gt;
+ Regards this, &quot;By default, do not let tests write any temporary files to /tmp. Instead, the tests should write to the location specified by the test.build.data system property.&quot;, tell user to look at HBaseTestingUtility.  It has defines for test dir setup.&lt;br/&gt;
+ This is incorrect. &quot;If a HBase cluster is needed by your test, either subclass org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseClusterTestCase or use org.apache.hadoop.hbase.MiniHBaseCluster. If you also need to use a MapReduce cluster, use org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MiniMRCluster.&quot;  Again see HTU.&lt;br/&gt;
+ You can do &apos;mvn test&apos; in maven to just run tests.  Or &apos;mvn test -Dtest=CLASSNAME&apos;   Point to the mvn wiki page I&apos;d say.&lt;br/&gt;
+ Does this need a &apos;-p&apos; on it --&amp;gt; &quot;git diff&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;
+ Have patchnames end in &apos;txt&apos; rather than &apos;patch&apos; so we can open patch easy in browser.&lt;br/&gt;
+Says &quot;Hadoop source&quot; instead of &quot;hbase source&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
+ You might want to check out the hadoop page on same subject.  This page was taken from thre originally and they may have deviated... might be good stuff over on the hadoop page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for doing this D.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12871348" author="dploeg" created="Tue, 25 May 2010 20:42:41 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;thanks stack. I&apos;ve included your changes with the following notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the &quot;-p&quot; option for &quot;git diff&quot; is the default. It doesn&apos;t make a different if you leave it out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I noticed that hadoop are using checkstyle as part of their build to help enforce code quality. I think maybe we should do something similar - perhaps as a separate jira.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also added a note to include the apache license header at the start of the file.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

All issues that have been resolved and where all fixVersions have been released have been closed (following discussions on the mailing list).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
