            <title>[HBASE-1403] Move transactional and indexer hbase out of core into contrib or out to their own project</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1403</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Its a bit of work bringing along these hbase subclasses as changes happen in core.  They are substantial enough contributions, they could be their own projects &amp;#8211; if there was the will to keep them up.  Otherwise, we could move them down into contrib. &amp;#8211; that&apos;d better demark core and this hbase customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote Clint asking what he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I can understand the feeling from the core developers like they have to do extra work to keep the sub-servers working. But is it really that cumbersome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else being equal, I&apos;d prefer to keep the stuff inside hbase-core. One reason is that it will help dissuade breaking changes to the relevant parts of the API. Another is increased visibility to attract new users/developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can pitch in to get the servers working again for 0.20 if need be.  It seemed straightforward when I got them working in trunk a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately its the core-dev&apos;s call as to what is best for the hbase community. If ya&apos;ll feel that the servers are too much a burden, then I can live with it as an outside extension.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12708553" author="stack" created="Tue, 12 May 2009 18:30:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Above seems reasonable to me &amp;#8211; especially the bit where its keeping us honest regards API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, changing THBase and ITHBase is not that much work its just that I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll break it or just not give it the attention it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might instead work on moving THBase and ITHBase pollution that is up in core out and down into the THBase and ITHBase implementations.  I&apos;m thinking of the HLog and HCD.  HLog values are a HLogEdit which is now just the new KeyValue class + a THBase flag.  In interests of performance, I&apos;d like to not have to create a HLogEdit at all and just shove in the KeyValue.  If THBase needs more than that, lets make it so you can do it in subclass.  Similarly for HCD.  Every toString includes the bit about indexes &amp;#8211; an ITHBase-ism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good stuff Clint.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12708557" author="apurtell" created="Tue, 12 May 2009 18:39:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think HLogEdit would still be needed for something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1295&quot; title=&quot;Multi data center replication&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-1295&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-1295&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for noting the edit source so values are not re-replicated back to the peer. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12708579" author="stack" created="Tue, 12 May 2009 19:27:59 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Can we do these markings as Types in the new KeyValue?  Before serializing we could AND the key type with source.  How many bits do you need?  Clint, what about you doing your types in same way?  AND&apos;ing or a new type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If KeyValue.Type will do it, lets make the changes now before 0.20.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12708582" author="apurtell" created="Tue, 12 May 2009 19:34:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t imagine more than 128 peer clusters for a replicator scenario, so 7 bits of Type would be enough, as long as they could be reserved somehow. ( &quot;Who needs more than 640K?&quot; &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; )  So maybe top 8 bits excluding the sign?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12708584" author="stack" created="Tue, 12 May 2009 19:35:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Type is a byte only in KV.  So, maximum you can have is 4, maybe 5 bits &amp;#8211; smile.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12708615" author="clint.morgan" created="Tue, 12 May 2009 20:42:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Without digging to deep, I&apos;m pretty sure I could make the KeyValue.Type work for the transactional logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to break/remove whatever of the transactional logging stuff is in the way. I&apos;ll pick up the pieces once the rest of the infrastructure starts to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="14087447" author="zzly" created="Wed, 6 Aug 2014 09:08:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi,stack, will you please tell me the detail reason why you move the index down? Also, the current version is 0.98.1, Do you consider to recover the index part to main version?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14088390" author="stack" created="Wed, 6 Aug 2014 22:35:22 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=zzly&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;zzly&quot;&gt;Liang Li&lt;/a&gt; We moved this code out of hbase because it was burdensome to support and specialized with a single maintainer not always present.  Any reason why you are asking about an event that happened 5 years ago.  You are interested in transactional/indexed hbase?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14088847" author="zzly" created="Thu, 7 Aug 2014 05:25:41 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your reply. Yes, I am interesting in transactional/indexed hbase. In my opinion, if add index to HBase, the read performance will be improved a lot; but until now, there is no solution for this.Can you tell me your consideration about this issue? Is this unnecessary for HBase? &lt;br/&gt;
 Thak you!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
