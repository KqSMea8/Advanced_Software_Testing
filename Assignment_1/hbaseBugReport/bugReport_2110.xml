                            <comment id="12800749" author="lars_francke" created="Fri, 15 Jan 2010 16:44:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong on this one but I think this happened before the move to Ivy and I think it is because the CSS file is sent with a MIME type of text/html since &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6441&quot; title=&quot;Prevent remote CSS attacks in Hostname and UTF-7.&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-6441&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-6441&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The HDFS interface isn&apos;t broken though so I&apos;m not 100% sure how they are doing it. I&apos;ll have a look.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12800803" author="lars_francke" created="Fri, 15 Jan 2010 18:11:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It is definitely the MIME type that is causing the problem so I checked why the HDFS interface works and saw that its CSS was served as text/html, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBase on Firefox: Error: The stylesheet &lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.1.23:60010/static/hbase.css&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.23:60010/static/hbase.css&lt;/a&gt; was not loaded because its MIME type, &quot;text/html&quot;, is not &quot;text/css&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
HDFS on Firefox: Warning: The stylesheet &lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.1.23:50070/static/hadoop.css&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.23:50070/static/hadoop.css&lt;/a&gt; was loaded as CSS even though its MIME type, &quot;text/html&quot;, is not &quot;text/css&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference: HBase is rendered in standards mode because of the DOCTYPE, HDFS is rendered in Quirks mode because it doesn&apos;t define a DOCTYPE. Once I removed it from the JSP everything worked again. I don&apos;t consider that the fix though. I&apos;ll open a ticket for Hadoop to send the correct MIME type for CSS files and link it to this one (as a side effect of this I&apos;ve fixed the JSP to comply to XHTML, I suppose I should open a new ticket for that?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess would be that you probably noticed this first when Ivy was introduced because new snapshots of the Hadoop dependencies were pulled.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12800804" author="stack" created="Fri, 15 Jan 2010 18:14:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@ Lars You are a good man.  Thanks for figuring this.  It had me stumped (Was using chrome at the time.  No warnings about mimetype though has fancy stylesheet inspector which was styling nicely with old hbases but was mute on the post-ivy trunk).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12801097" author="lars_francke" created="Sat, 16 Jan 2010 04:53:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks and no problem! I was stumped too - I&apos;m a Chrome user as well and it reported no problems. It even downloaded the CSS and showed it to me but it wouldn&apos;t apply it. Firebug loaded the file and then said &quot;No rules found&quot; but when I clicked &quot;edit&quot; in Firebug everything was there and as soon as I changed a single character everything worked... that was one stupid bug to find (especially considering that it worked for the Hadoop page but not HBase)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve filed an issue with Hadoop Commons (linked it to this one) and I hope they&apos;ll find a solution. Doesn&apos;t sound like there is an easy fix that is not a &quot;hack&quot;. I&apos;ll update this issue when the underlying problem is resolved. For now you can just delete the DOCTYPE declaration from all .jsp files to get the CSS back.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12877702" author="stack" created="Fri, 11 Jun 2010 03:46:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Moving out of 0.21.  I don&apos;t see breakage probably because as per Lars F above, we&apos;ve removed the DTD from all jsp.  This is just a workaround though so will leave this open.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12932160" author="lars_francke" created="Mon, 15 Nov 2010 19:32:59 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The problem has been fixed in Hadoop but as far as I can tell it&apos;s only in trunk so we need to keep those DTDs out of the JSPs until Hadoop 0.22 is released and used by HBase.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13134601" author="stack" created="Mon, 24 Oct 2011 22:57:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I commented out DOCTYPE for now in 0.92 branch and in TRUNK.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13286190" author="stack" created="Wed, 30 May 2012 23:37:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;As suggested by Alex, no longer applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
