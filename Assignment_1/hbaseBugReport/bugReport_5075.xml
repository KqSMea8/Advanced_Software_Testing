                    <description>&lt;p&gt;regionserver crashed,it is too long time to notify hmaster.when hmaster know regionserver&apos;s shutdown,it is long time to fetch the hlog&apos;s lease.&lt;br/&gt;
hbase is a online db, availability is very important.&lt;br/&gt;
i have a idea to improve availability, monitor node to check regionserver&apos;s pid.if this pid not exsits,i think the rs down,i will delete the znode,and force close the hlog file.&lt;br/&gt;
so the period maybe 100ms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

if some regionserver carshed ,we can&apos;t wait too long to recovery service.&lt;br/&gt;
so my patch is to improve the ability of failover in hbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i come from alipay in china, we have some hbase cluster online, we have the second big cluster in china.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13203425" author="junhua.yang" created="Wed, 8 Feb 2012 09:45:01 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;hi,&lt;br/&gt;
I think it is very important to shortent the recovery time.&lt;br/&gt;
Now waiting the regionserver recovery sometimes is very long and not acceptable for online service.&lt;br/&gt;
Lots of  error from client will be thrown and affect the custom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So could you help to provide your solution and   @stack,  how do you think about hbase failover solution now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any plan to improve it?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

 expire region server znode may be depend on zk&apos;s session time out,so we can use ping and check pid to perceive rs&apos;s crashed event,and ten we delete znode.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13210367" author="stack" created="Fri, 17 Feb 2012 16:39:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for doing this.  It looks very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not reformat existing code.  It bloats your patch and makes reviews take longer; reviewer attention span is short (at least in this case) and its a shame to spend it going over code reformats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the patch, is this necessary: +  public String getRSPidAndRsZknode();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&apos;t you get the pid from a process listing?  Or you want us to publish it via jmx?   Or it looks like it is already published via jmx.  Can your tool pick it up there?  On the znode, can&apos;t you get the regionserver servername and then do lookup in zk directly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&apos;t you have supervisor do this?  Is there not existing utilities that watch a pid and allow you do stuff when its gone?  Or is it that you&apos;d kill the server if a long GC pause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a bit of documentation on how this new utility works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Is this guarding against just the RegionServer process dying (but its machine still up), or also against the machine dying? (I know I could take a closer look at the patch, but it&apos;s easier if you just tell me) &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I am sorry for that i have reformated the existing code,i will do another patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two versions of this work.We have implemented version 1 that can&apos;t check machine dying but can check process crashed.The next version will realize all about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks for your reply.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

First the rpc method getRSPidAndRsZknode is to fetch PID and znode which includes domain and service port,this way is reliable. If we use processes list, there may be some misjudgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second there is a supervisor called RegionServerFailureDetection,we first start regionserver, and then start RegionServerFailureDetection.RegionServerFailureDetection is a watchdog of RegionServer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the supervisor(RegionServerFailureDetection) of regionserver fetch PID and znode by getRSPidAndRsZknode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RegionServerFailureDetection doesn&apos;t have any relationship with long GC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RegionServerFailureDetection first check whether PID is alive and the check service port is alive.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a bit worried about maintaining an additional process on every machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about doing something a bit simpler like adding a runtime shutdown hook to the RS such that the region server will update ZK or the master when it decides to bail out. Even something as simple as just removing your own znode on failure would be sufficient to cover this use case, correct?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13215796" author="stack" created="Fri, 24 Feb 2012 18:39:36 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even something as simple as just removing your own znode on failure would be sufficient to cover this use case, correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course that does not help if the RegionServer is &quot;kill -9&apos;d&quot;, or the RegionServer&apos;s machine just dies, or there&apos;s a network partition, etc, in which case we&apos;d need to rely on the ZK timeout.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13216589" author="lhofhansl" created="Sun, 26 Feb 2012 00:25:24 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;On 2nd thought. The ephemeral node can only be deleted as long as the ZK connection is active, which is by no means guaranteed for any shutdown hook, also not sure about causing network IO from a shutdown hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the HRegion.run() it looks like we pretty much in all cases reach the point where deleteMyEphemeralNode is called. Hmm...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13216625" author="jesse_yates" created="Sun, 26 Feb 2012 03:55:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Had the same concerns about the network IO and (I think) blocking call. However, with the shutdown hook, I think we can be &lt;em&gt;more sure&lt;/em&gt; that it runs, rather than putting it after the run method. Also, the hooks run in their own thread, so on shutdown, its not going to block regular shutdown or any other synchronous operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this doesn&apos;t deal with the kill -9 or network partition situation, but if that happens, you have some big problems anyways and a minute (or whatever your zk timeout is) of blocking probably isn&apos;t a big deal &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; Also note, that in the latter case there, the daemon wouldn&apos;t be able to reach zk anyways to eliminate the node, so you are back to where you were before. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13216672" author="zhiyuan.daizy" created="Sun, 26 Feb 2012 08:42:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@Jesse&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks for your reply.&lt;br/&gt;
I think HBase is a online DB. How long HBase failover takes is very important. Although kill -9 or network partition situation is a big event,the supervisor can judge that it&apos;s regionserver has crushed within ms,and hmaster can move regions which opened in the crushed regionserver to other alive regionservers.Therefore, the failover time is reduced to be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stack and Lars said,shutdownhook is called when the regionserver process is alive and program logic isn&apos;t interrupted.The event which is kill -9 can&apos;t trigger event that shutdownhook would be called,so the the method deleteMyEphemeralNode would not be executed,in which case we&apos;d need to rely on the ZK timeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My patch is order to reduce the failover time, which improves the availability of HBase.We have some big online hbase clusters which are all the core applications, and the acceptable failover time of the applications is about 10s~20s which include splitting hlog and recovering hlog lease and &apos;zk timeout&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

If you need to have hbase regionservers dump out their servername so you know what to kill up in zk, that can be done easy enough....&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

First, thank you.&lt;br/&gt;
Sorry, I don&apos;t quite understand your meaning.Do you means another project instead of writing code into hbase?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13217183" author="nkeywal" created="Mon, 27 Feb 2012 13:35:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;In the case that you want to manage (region server crash without any hardware issue, i.e. a pure application bug), a possible solution as well is loop in the launch script. This typically allows 20s failover (stop time + start time), and is even compatible with hotfailover. It&apos;s faster and less error prone than monitoring pid. But for HBase it would be a new start mode. It could make sense if we observe much more application bugs than hw issues (this solution is quite common with C/C++ stuff as it&apos;s easy to crash a process with these languages...)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Yes sir.  Process babysitters is a pretty mature domain w/ a wide variety of existing programs that have been debugged and are able to do this for you.  What do you think about using one of the existing solutions rather than write your own?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The scenario is in individual machine, check the HRegionServer in less than 1000ms.&lt;br/&gt;
It is not enough for only shell script, My solution is : a tiny c/as program monitor the HRegionServer in less than 1000ms, and a shell script (using loop/in crontab) to monitor c/as program.&lt;br/&gt;
Also if we wanna more, we can use MC Serviceguard like etc.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
