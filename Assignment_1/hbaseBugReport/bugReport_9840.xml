            <title>[HBASE-9840] Large scans and BlockCache evictions problems</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9840</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I just ran into a scenario that baffled me first, but after some reflection makes sense. I ran a very large scan that filled up most of the block cache with my scan&apos;s data. I ran that scan a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I ran a much smaller scan, and this scan will never get all its blocks cached if it does not fit entirely into the remaining BlockCache; regardless how I often I run it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the blocks of the first large scan were all promoted. Since the 2nd scan did not fully fit into the cache all blocks are round-robin evicted as I rerun the scan. Thus those blocks will never get accessed more than once before they get evicted again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since promoted blocks are not demoted the large scan&apos;s block will never be evicted unless we have another small enough scan/get that can promote its blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the proper solution is, but it seems only a LRU cache that can expire blocks over time would solve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this is a pretty special case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: My usual spelling digressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13805086" author="vrodionov" created="Fri, 25 Oct 2013 06:28:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of running large scan (larger than available young gen cache space) with cacheBlock enabled? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a couple comments on LruBlockCache design and implementation. I did not spend much time analyzing the code though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  singleFactor = 0.25, multiFactor = 0.5 , memoryFactor = 0.25 - are all hard-coded. They must be configurable.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Default values are probably not optimal at all. If it is attempt to mimic LRU2Q cache than optimal split for first insert is closer to 0.75 (I think I read it on Facebook engineering)&lt;br/&gt;
3. Eviction does not follow LRU2Q at all. In LRU2Q all data is evicted from the tail of a common queue (say, single and multi bucket CAN NOT be processed separately but together). In LruBlockCache all 3 buckets evict their data independently.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13805448" author="lhofhansl" created="Fri, 25 Oct 2013 16:50:14 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Normally you&apos;d not cache your blocks on large scan (that&apos;s why &quot;this is a pretty special case&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;
Yeah #3 would fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not immediately important, just a note that our caching needs work &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13805482" author="jdcryans" created="Fri, 25 Oct 2013 17:26:54 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;singleFactor = 0.25, multiFactor = 0.5 , memoryFactor = 0.25 - are all hard-coded. They must be configurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meh, +0, see the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default values are probably not optimal at all. If it is attempt to mimic LRU2Q cache than optimal split for first insert is closer to 0.75 (I think I read it on Facebook engineering)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its javadoc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each priority will retain close to its maximum size, however, if any priority is not using its entire chunk the others are able to grow beyond their chunk size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you aren&apos;t using the in-memory part, you effectively dedicate 75% of your BC to the multi priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eviction does not follow LRU2Q at all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2Q suffers from different problems, mainly the tuning of Kin and Kout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;best&quot; page replacement policy is one that takes into account age and frequency of access, but we can&apos;t use ARC.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;1. cache entries never expire.&lt;br/&gt;
2. all buckets manage eviction independently. &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13805563" author="jdcryans" created="Fri, 25 Oct 2013 18:28:08 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When all three buckets become full all new blocks are inserted at 0.25 split in a queue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but like I am saying 2Q has its own configs that you can&apos;t change at runtime and you will hit another edgy use case that isn&apos;t able to use all the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
