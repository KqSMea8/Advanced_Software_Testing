            <title>[HBASE-1790] filters are not working correctly</title>

                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Filters used in Scanning the table are not working correctly. For example a table with three rows:&lt;br/&gt;
1. rowkey = adminbackslash-nb0, desc:temp = &quot;temp&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
2. rowkey = adminbackslash-nb1, desc:temp = &quot;temp&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
3. rowkey = adminkleptoman, desc:temp = &quot;temp&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I scan all rows in the table without filter I get all the rows as expected. But applying a simple prefixfilter with parameter &quot;adminbackslash&quot; will return only first row. I searched it down to HRegion::nextInternal method, which will not output one passed row before denied row(by filter). &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12748757" author="backslash" created="Fri, 28 Aug 2009 09:12:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I would ask you to pay attention to my post from few days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anybody using filters when scanning table? I recently created &quot;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1790&quot; title=&quot;filters are not working correctly&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-1790&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-1790&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) filters are not working correctly&quot; and submitted a patch, but latter I found that stateful filters are still not working. I have already rewrited the HRegion::nextInternal function and filters(not submitted patch yet). As I see it, there were more problems.&lt;br/&gt;
1. filters are applyed before deleted rows were discarted(so they were count in when scaning, this is problem for PageFilter)&lt;br/&gt;
2. filters like PageFilter reset their state in reset function, but this function is called in HRegion::nextInternal, so it would be good to mention in javadoc for Filter::reset, where in the process of filtering is this method called.&lt;br/&gt;
3. last problem is a question, why there is Filter::filterRow called in HRegion::nextInternal, when it should be called after Filter::filterKeyValue(KeyValue) which is not called in HRegion::nextInternal.&lt;br/&gt;
So my last question is, is anybody using filters, because their are seriously not working correctly at all. And if there is someone, which filter do you use?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically, the patch is not working for statefull filters, but I could make one, which apparently work, but I would be very grateful if somebody tests it. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

As to whether folks are using filters, the answer must be no... or at least not in any seriious way.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12748882" author="davelatham" created="Fri, 28 Aug 2009 16:27:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We are using filters extensively in our deployment on 0.19 HEAD.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12748961" author="clint.morgan" created="Fri, 28 Aug 2009 19:41:19 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We use filters (mostly FilterList and ValueFilter) on 0.20 to answer AND/OR type criteria. Not much use of staful filters except as needed in ValueFilter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For prefixing/start/stop rows we adjust the Scan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For paging, we use a wrapper on the Scan which skips over the first results then stops scanning after pageNum results. I realize thats not ideal as we unnecessarily pay transport on the first skipped rows, then pay the cost to get the N+1 row. I&apos;d love to see PageFilter working!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12749038" author="backslash" created="Sat, 29 Aug 2009 00:10:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Clint, thank you for comment. I am glad, that filters are something, which is used atleast somewhere. Stack, I will look into unit tests tomorow and I will also submit the patch. Dave, which filters are you using? Is it possible, that filters are working correctly in 0.19?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12749080" author="stack" created="Sat, 29 Aug 2009 05:26:55 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Matus: Here is a TestFilter template that does the testing at the HRegion interface.  It might help you get going (I was afraid you&apos;d try to figure how best to test this and wander into the weeds and we&apos;d never hear from you again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards filters, the API and implementation changed in 0.20.0 so yeah, they work for Dave and partially for others (such as Clint) but seems to be issues here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for helping out.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12749129" author="davelatham" created="Sat, 29 Aug 2009 13:31:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Matus, we use several custom filter implementations that commonly deserialize some of the data in the region server and filters out rows based on data in the row, column, or cell.  They work great for us, and are a definite performance gain.  It will definitely be important for them to be working in 0.20 before we migrate.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12749151" author="streamy" created="Sat, 29 Aug 2009 14:25:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This adds a prefix test to stack&apos;s framework and then makes a change inside of HRegion.nextInternal() to return the current result if there is one (once we hit a filtered row key).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was happening was we put the second row in the result (List&amp;lt;KV&amp;gt;), iterated to the third, it said filter it, so we iterated the scanner, cleared the result, and returned.  So even though the second KV should have been returned, the third KV forced a full clear of the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a check that if we just hit a new row (currentRow != row) and there is something still in the result (!result.isEmpty()), then return w/o clearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also modified prefix filter to be more stateful so that it knows once it has passed it&apos;s prefix.  Once passed the prefix, it returns filterAllRemaining() as true, so this further cleans up the test case.  Without that, when running this at the Region level, we end up returning an empty result list on the third call rather than the second call returning false (that we are done).  Since we actually can determine we are done in this case, because the prefix has been passed, adding it cleans that up so we return the correct result in the second call, and that call also returns false letting up know that there will be no more matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to update one test (I think I actually wrote it) that tested FilterList MUST_PASS_ONE because it was running against a key passed the prefix, and then reversing back to the prefix.  That&apos;s impossible behavior so I slightly modified the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure whether this is totally right but in debugging it made sense.  All tests I&apos;ve run pass.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12749165" author="backslash" created="Sat, 29 Aug 2009 16:57:53 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Jonathan I see what you tried to do, but if we need to make the Prefix filter stateful(or any other filter) than the HRegion.nextInternal method is basicaly depending on filter to be able to tell, if there will be no more accepted rows, before filtering them. This is possible for alfanumeric filters like prefix filter, but I think, it will break down with ValueFilter and a situation on last passed row, because ValueFilter cant tell if there would be any acceptable rows, before aplying filter. So I rewrite the nextInternal and next method. Also I rewrite the test file TestFilter. There are 4 test methods now: without filter, prefixfilter(dont need to apply jonathans patch), pagefilter and valuefilter. And I also add new filter StartPageFilter, which is the same as PageFilter, but you can specify how many rows should be skipped before the paging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am developing on windows, so I dont have the best conditions for running tests. Although this nextInternal implementation passed TestFilter tests, I am not sure, if it will passed all the others tests. If anybody can try this it would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was searching for all usages of InternalScanner.next function, which basicaly take the result of nextInternal in case of HRegion and thus should return false if this is the last row, I came accross HMerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while(rootScanner.next(results)) {&lt;br/&gt;
          for(KeyValue kv: results) {&lt;br/&gt;
            HRegionInfo info = Writables.getHRegionInfoOrNull(kv.getValue());&lt;br/&gt;
            if (info != null) &lt;/p&gt;
{
              metaRegions.add(info);
            }
&lt;p&gt;          }&lt;br/&gt;
        }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like, it expects rootScanner.next(results) to be true for every row and not for every row except the last. So Stack, should we correct this?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12749616" author="stack" created="Mon, 31 Aug 2009 20:31:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The piece you pasted from HMerge looks broke to me Matus.  Please add a fix to your patch please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pagefilter, please just remove rather than comment-out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
-    rowsAccepted = 0;
+    &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;//rowsAccepted = 0;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do the same commenting out elsewhere in your patch.  Please just remove the replaced code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The StartPageFilter needs to have in its class javadoc why its different from PageFilter.  Or, better, can we not just have PageFilter do what StartPageFilter does (pass 0 for pageStart if you want PageFilter behavior and N if you want to do StartPageFilter actions?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by way of FYI, fellas usually make the patch in the $HBASE_HOME dir.  Yours was made  in $HBASE_HOME/src. ... just for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it seems as though this patch breaks other hbase tests.  I&apos;ll try taking a look why in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

Makes a few changes to HRegion code and how filters are run.  Modifies some existing tests to match updated semantics.  Add &quot;early-out&quot; to a few existing filters so that we don&apos;t require an additional round-trip when we know we are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also includes a modified version of Andrew&apos;s patch from &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1807&quot; title=&quot;KeyFilter for filtering based on comparsions of row, column, and qualifiers of KeyValues&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-1807&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-1807&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More work to be done, not ready for review...  Just checkpointing.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12750599" author="streamy" created="Wed, 2 Sep 2009 18:35:21 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Patch will deal with these other issues as well.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12750660" author="streamy" created="Wed, 2 Sep 2009 20:53:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Completely changes the KeyFilter stuff from apurtell patch over in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1807&quot; title=&quot;KeyFilter for filtering based on comparsions of row, column, and qualifiers of KeyValues&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-1807&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-1807&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but retains all the functionality besides family checking (after clarifying with user on list that he was in fact not looking for that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds more tests.  New tests are in TestFilter.  There are lots of them, though could use more FilterList tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds a couple new classes to filters... BinaryComparator which is a WritableBAComparable implementing wrapper of Bytes.compareTo().  CompareFilter is a superclass for RowFilter, QualifierFilter, and ValueFilter classes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing ValueFilter has become SingleColumnValueFilter which is what it actually does.  I actually removed the filterRowIfColumnMissing stuff and instead created a wrapping filter SkipFilter.  You wrap a KV checking filter with it, and if any KVs in the row fail, the entire row is filtered out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple changes in HRegion code to actually fix filters.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12750661" author="streamy" created="Wed, 2 Sep 2009 20:55:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Please review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse the small extra-line formatting error in HRegion.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Put CompareOp enum in CompareFilter now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SkipFilter javadoc is confusing. I think you are missing a &quot;not&quot; in &quot;Any row which did not have the given value for the specified column will be emitted. &quot; Should be &quot;Any row which did not have the given value for the specified column will NOT be emitted. &quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some classes missing in the HbaseObjectWritable map? BinaryComparator, CompareFilter, QualifierFilter, RowFilter, SkipFilter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests look great. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12750681" author="stack" created="Wed, 2 Sep 2009 21:40:24 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Should CompareFilter be abstract (Its useless standalone).   Others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh. Do we have to make a new HBaseConfiguration serializing?  That looks way broke.  Can we fix?  We should use HBaseObjectWritable anyways? If I look in HOW, its just using it to make a NullWritable.... do we even do this?  I can change HOW so we create a HBC if we need to do a nullwritable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made CompareFilter abstract.  Moved CompareOp to CompareFilter.  Added new classes to HOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure what to do about HBC.  Definitely agree we should not instantiate new ones in serialization.  I&apos;m open to whatever will work &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
