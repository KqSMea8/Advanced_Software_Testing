&lt;p&gt;This is a huge patch! Could give an overview of what this adds, which files does what, etc? Thx!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12805454" author="larsgeorge" created="Wed, 27 Jan 2010 10:21:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK, the patch adds a new contrib package all complete with its own build.xml. Please read the INSTALL.txt and README.txt included to see what it does in detail. It adds a single class that acts as a swiss-army-knife JMX tool. It can scan servers to see what attributes and operations are exposed, query them subsequently and check the values to be in a certain range. It is based on what Ed Capriolo has implemented (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jointhegrid.com/hadoop/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.jointhegrid.com/hadoop/&lt;/a&gt;) but simplifies the usage. Ed came from a generic perspective while I came from a HBase one, so I moved settings to an external properties file instead of having classes for each version. I adjusted his set of graph templates to match the new layout. The build.xml allows to build a jar matching the current release but also has the ability to build a custom jar for various reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The INSTALL.txt explains how to do this all and how to use the resulting jar with Cacti and Nagios. Goal of the contrib is to enable our users to quickly set up graphing with more elaborate combined graphs (as opposed to graphs single values with Ganglia for example) and also monitoring with Nagios or similar tools to get notifications when something is awry.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12830104" author="larsgeorge" created="Fri, 5 Feb 2010 13:41:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Given the recent discussing about no contrib I assume this gets a -1 as it is somewhat not core and we have the supplied Ganglia support already. Nagios monitoring makes totally sense but can be added later on so no need to add this now. Am I reasoning that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems you are at the spot where I was a while back &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4594&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4594&lt;/a&gt;. (pretty much the spot that inspired hadoop-cacti-jtg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, hadoop+hbase has built in ganglia support. It works in that in does push metrics to a ganglia cluster, but it has its detractions. For me these are, often changing attributes and object names, missing vivid documentation of what counters mean, and being forced into a monitoring system (ganglia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand it makes a lot of sense to call cacti/nagios scripts &quot;contrib&quot; and take the stance that they are not easily unit testable and thus do not belong in hadoop core. Of course, you can reverse the argument &quot;just because you can patch in ganglia support, does that mean that only an NMS that can be patched in (pushed based nms) should be officially supported&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we have hadoop-cacti-jtg, because ganglia does not meet everyone&apos;s needs but it is the only NMS that seems to be able to make its way in. Every other NMS seems to be classified as unneeded contrib. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12830147" author="appodictic" created="Fri, 5 Feb 2010 16:01:53 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;For example I have noticed things like this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matejunkie.com/hadoop-dfs-check-plugin-for-nagios/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.matejunkie.com/hadoop-dfs-check-plugin-for-nagios/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is a fine script, but this person took the approach of using sudo, shell scripts that parse the output of dfsadmin, awk, etc etc. If we had reasonable scripts included in the distribution that work with nagios (the most widely used NMS BTW), we would solve a practical problem for most people.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12830158" author="larsgeorge" created="Fri, 5 Feb 2010 16:38:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Indeed Ed, just until recently contrib was pretty much the right place. But then a vote came up to toss out every contrib and either make it part of core or force it to get into their own habitat. That seems to be the status-quo and in that light I thought I move what I submitted at least into my github repo. It will not even compile yet as the build.xml includes the build-contrib.xml from HBase. But I will fix it and make it so that it compiles at least. It still has the same purpose, provide a complete HBase oriented package and I will make sure I maintain it for that reason (standard checks and RPC graphs are missing still etc. anyways). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that make sense.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12830178" author="stack" created="Fri, 5 Feb 2010 17:23:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The ganglia support comes from hadoop.   In hbase we just emit metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t much to this jmxtoolkit.  We might entertain adding it to core.  How would it work?  You&apos;d add a target to build.xml and it&apos;d generate the cacti drop-in jar.  How would we know if its broken or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it looks nice where it is now, no?  We already have an article on monitoring hbase.  What if we added a section on nagios/cacti and  pointed out to jmxtoolkit over in github?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Lars, no vote was taken on contrib discussion &amp;#8211; just discussion to see what all are thinking on the topic of contribs).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12854379" author="larsgeorge" created="Wed, 7 Apr 2010 08:35:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;As we have no consensus here I&apos;d like to push this out of 0.20.4 as this is no real hold up but nice to have. I also updated my GitHub version with more features and fixes (did the same for Ed&apos;s repository to keep them in sync). We can either close the entire issue or push it out and see what comes out of it? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12854736" author="stack" created="Wed, 7 Apr 2010 23:50:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Moved to 0.20.5.  Lars, have you added your github to supporting projects in meantime?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12856995" author="larsgeorge" created="Wed, 14 Apr 2010 17:58:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yes I have added &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/larsgeorge/jmxtoolkit&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://github.com/larsgeorge/jmxtoolkit&lt;/a&gt; to Supporting Projects. Let&apos;s see if there is any further interest but if not that we leave it as it is and close this as &quot;DNC&quot; (as Ryan put it).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
