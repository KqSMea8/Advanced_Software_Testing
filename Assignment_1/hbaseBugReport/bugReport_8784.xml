            <title>[HBASE-8784] Wildcard/Range/Partition Delete Support</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8784</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We often see use-cases where users, for example with timeseries data, would like to do deletes of large ranges of data, basically like a delete of a partition as supported by RDBMSs. We should support regular expressions or range expressions for the matches (supporting binary keys obviously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to store the deletes not with the data, but the meta data. When we read files we read the larger deletes first, and then the inline ones. Of course, this should be reserved for few but very data intensive deletes. This reduces the number of deletes to write to one, instead of many (often thousands, if not millions). This is different from the BulkDeleteEndpoint introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-6942&quot; title=&quot;Endpoint implementation for bulk deletion of data&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-6942&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-6942&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It should support similar Scan based selectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new range deletes will mask out all the matching data and handled otherwise like other deletes, for example being dropped during major compactions, once all masked data has been dropped too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be discussed is how and where we store the delete entry in practice, since meta data might not be wanted. But it seems like a reasonable choice. The DeleteTracker can handle the delete the same with additional checks for wildcards/ranges. If the deletes are not used, no critical path is affected, therefore not causing any additional latencies or other regressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13690437" author="lhofhansl" created="Fri, 21 Jun 2013 16:15:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Interesting idea. You want to store these in the HFiles&apos; metadata block? Or somehow in .META.? Or in a new new &quot;DeleteRange&quot; table?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a similar problem, and we decided to resort to coprocessor hooks during compactions, where the hook reads the metadata from somewhere else and then just filters the data out by some criteria. Obviously this only works in &quot;delete this stuff some time when you get to it&quot; type scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13691109" author="larsgeorge" created="Sat, 22 Jun 2013 11:17:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I did think of the meta blocks in the files. The issue is of course that these &quot;super&quot; deletes span possibly multiple regions and even servers. Your suggestion of .META. and/or a special delete table therefore makes sense to synchronize this across all of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding an extra table triggers a lot of questions I presume, like how to handle that efficiently and consistently (namespaces etc.). Which of the two would you think is more manageable/less intrusive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your approach, that is indeed a user-land implementation of a similar feature, and the semantics about when data is freed is also the same as any other delete. Dropping deleted data faster (maybe even securely like discussed on the mailing list right now) is a whole different story.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
