            <title>[HBASE-4527] Fix versioning such that every update is unique</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4527</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use checkAndPut but there is a case where the check will not fail though the cell has been updated: if a cell is update with exactly the value it had before, we&apos;ll not know its been changed.  hbase-4507 did a checkAndPut where you could pass a timestamp as part of the check so we&apos;d check the cell value AND that the timestamp was the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would work in most regards but one; an update is done in the same millisecond.  This is generally impossible but in a distributed system where clocks drift and a region can be moved to a server whose clock is retarded, it is within the realm of possibilities that it could happen.  So we should deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thought is that the version is made for sure unique.  We could make the timestamp wider still so probability of the edits arriving within the same microsecond &amp;#8211; or whatever it is that a double gives you &amp;#8211; would require us to run through a couple of billion universe expand/contract cycles or we could have a monotonically increasing sequence id per millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be some overlap between this issue and the persisting of rwcc to the filesystem (though not currently as rwcc is implemented).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But we&apos;d then have to expose RWCC to the API because checkAndPut would need to specify it?  ugh&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13119753" author="tlipcon" created="Mon, 3 Oct 2011 23:36:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t like exposing the internal TS to the user.. I think when users want to implement optimistic concurrency control they should be including their own version number as a true column with real data.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
