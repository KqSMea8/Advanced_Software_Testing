            <title>[HBASE-7317] consider &quot;full-featured&quot; support for HTrace for HBase debugging</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-7317</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve seen cases during integration tests where the write or read request took an unexpectedly large amount of time (that, after the client went to the region server that is reported alive and well, which I know from temporary debug logging &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;), and it&apos;s impossible to understand what is going on on the server side, short of catching the moment with jstack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some solutions (off by default) could be &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a facility for tests (especially integration tests) that would trace Server/Master calls into some log or file (won&apos;t help with internals but at least one could see what was actually received);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;logging the progress of requests between components inside master/server (e.g. &quot;request id=N received&quot;, &quot;request id=N is being processed in MyClass&quot;, N being drawn on client from local sequence - no guarantees of uniqueness are necessary).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                            <comment id="13529532" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 01:09:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Start as an (optional) Maven dependency I&apos;d say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If htrace proves useful and we&apos;d like to modify or bundle it, we could reach out and ask Jon if he&apos;d consider a grant.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13529537" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 01:14:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hmm... I guess &quot;optional&quot; doesn&apos;t make much sense, still thinking of 0.94 and pluggable RPC engines, and then there&apos;s the thread wrapping. Maybe an experimental branch for evaluation?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    &amp;lt;htrace.version&amp;gt;1.49&amp;lt;/htrace.version&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The thing we lack are interesting trace points, such as before going to DFS, etc. We also lack a good central collector to coalesce the trace info and display it usefully.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13529677" author="stack" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 06:53:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;How to use htrace w/ hbase is documented in the refguide: &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#tracing&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#tracing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&amp;lt;htrace.version&amp;gt;1.49&amp;lt;/htrace.version&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we be depending on something that only has a single contributor and hasn&apos;t seen a commit in over three months?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530145" author="stack" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 17:52:50 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we be depending on something that only has a single contributor and hasn&apos;t seen a commit in over three months?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope was that we&apos;d add tracing to hbase w/ this as a start (and that hadoop itself would be adding trace I suppose so we could go down into datanodes).  If no progress on tracing before, say 0.96, yeah, lets remove it.  But maybe there will be progress made in this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards a central collector for traces, could try writing an hbase table.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530153" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 17:58:18 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair point&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also go in the other direction, reach out to Jon for a grant to &quot;port to Apache&quot; as Sergey said, and then carry it forward maintained in tree. It would need a sponsor, and work to make it useful along the lines that Todd and you suggest. Do we have that is the question.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530177" author="tlipcon" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 18:16:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The license is already Apache, so if someone wants to make changes and send a pull request, I&apos;m happy to pull them in and publish a new version of htrace. I don&apos;t think we need substantial changes to htrace itself - more work is remaining in the trace collection / viewing area.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530180" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 18:21:14 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The license is already Apache, so if someone wants to make changes and send a pull request, I&apos;m happy to pull them in and publish a new version of htrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any chance of getting spans into HDFS with the current project hosting?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530203" author="sershe" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 18:49:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hmm, somehow I missed that in the book. That looks very useful &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I have looked at the source a bit; is there any good way to add debug information to Span-s, e.g. exceptions/etc.?&lt;br/&gt;
As far as I understand it currently would trace operation starts/ends, right?&lt;br/&gt;
From the patch in the JIRA that adds the hooks, it looks like more hooks should be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrt placement, is there a reason to not put it into org.apache.common..., with only HDFS/HBase/etc. specific receivers living in their corresponding projects?&lt;br/&gt;
I can do it when I have bandwidth if there are no legal/procedural objections or objections from the author.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530204" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 18:51:15 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrt placement, is there a reason to not put it into org.apache.common..., with only HDFS/HBase/etc. specific receivers living in their corresponding projects?

&lt;p&gt;+1 to this&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530273" author="tlipcon" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 20:06:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We can&apos;t put it in org.apache.* unless it&apos;s an Apache project. If you want to submit it to the incubator as a project I would be interested in joining up, but our thinking at the time of development was that it&apos;s a small enough piece of code that it would be easier to just develop on github until it got traction in a bunch of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s no restriction that Apache projects only depend on other Apache projects - eg we depend on Google libraries like protobuf and guava.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530275" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 20:09:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m pretty sure the thinking is a grant of this code to the Apache Hadoop project, not the formation of a full fledged project.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530403" author="tlipcon" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:04:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&apos;t want to put it in Hadoop common &amp;#8211; then we&apos;d have to do elaborate stubbing in our compat code in order to use it while still supporting older versions. It is also useful for non-Hadoop projects (eg something like Cassandra)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530410" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:08:28 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd: I wouldn&apos;t want to put it in Hadoop common &#8211; then we&apos;d have to do elaborate stubbing in our compat code in order to use it while still supporting older versions. It is also useful for non-Hadoop projects (eg something like Cassandra)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s disappointing. Then my concern about depending on a project in this state stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack: Hope was that we&apos;d add tracing to hbase w/ this as a start (and that hadoop itself would be adding trace I suppose so we could go down into datanodes). If no progress on tracing before, say 0.96, yeah, lets remove it. But maybe there will be progress made in this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, otherwise +1 for removing it for 0.96.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;What do you mean? If there are bugs in the code, feel free to submit patches, and I&apos;m happy to integrate them (I have commit access to the repo). If we end up with several contributors, I don&apos;t foresee any issues proposing it for Apache incubation.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13530429" author="apurtell" created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:21:57 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&apos;s progress on tracing, and certainly if this happens, then I won&apos;t be concerned, yes.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13531286" author="sershe" created="Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:30:08 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;How do you define progress on tracing? Improvements on the library, or adoption within HBase codebase?&lt;br/&gt;
Also, w.r.t. Apache, as far as I see to go into commons sandbox you don&apos;t need much of a separate project.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13531305" author="stack" created="Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:37:59 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you define progress on tracing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d define it as us making use of the lib.  Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+ Flip a switch in shell and it &apos;enables tracing&apos;.  Make a request and when the request completes, the trace info is dumped out in shell&lt;br/&gt;
+ Flip a switch on a regionserver and it will start dumping trace into the .log file or into the UI&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
