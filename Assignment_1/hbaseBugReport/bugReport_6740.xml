            <title>[HBASE-6740] Build out a toolset to make regular user operations on HBase tables</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-6740</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We currently have some stock MR jobs like import/export, copytable, importtsv etc and tools like hbck, hfile viewer, WAL viewer etc that are a part of HBase core. These are sometimes used just as is and often times need some sort of customization to make them work in user environments. I propose we build out a more extensive and extensible tool set and move it out to a separate package outside core so we can add to those and release those as they evolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13450842" author="stack" created="Fri, 7 Sep 2012 18:13:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Sounds good (I like moving stuff out of core). How you see it working AK?  What repo?  Who&apos;d have access?  Etc.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13450861" author="amansk" created="Fri, 7 Sep 2012 18:28:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Could very well be on Cloudera&apos;s public github for now, or could be a part of a separate package called hbase-tools in the current HBase repo. Access/commits don&apos;t necessarily have to be the same as they are for core at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have recommendations on where we could put them up? We don&apos;t necessarily have to get it right the first time. We can start with Cloudera&apos;s public repo and the code can be moved to some other repo if folks feel there&apos;s a more appropriate home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&apos;t have a strong opinion on where it should be hosted.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13451054" author="amansk" created="Fri, 7 Sep 2012 22:13:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yup, separate maven module works too.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13451070" author="stack" created="Fri, 7 Sep 2012 22:27:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hmm... what would having tools in a module do for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering more what this means &quot;...and often times need some sort of customization to make them work in user environments&quot;?  This involve changes to the core or are you finding yourself copy/pasting to add some needed facility that you&apos;d like to commit back and have available at a rate that is higher than that at which we release?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this facility would be for toolsmiths to share their improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we need to move current tools to the toolsmiths&apos; repo?  Or can they stay where they are and toolsmiths use hbase-tools repo for new stuff or amendments to core tools?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13451073" author="stack" created="Fri, 7 Sep 2012 22:28:05 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We could on a period review the hbase-tools repo to roll stuff back into core (this is opposite of what I said above but hey, brainstorming).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13453471" author="amansk" created="Tue, 11 Sep 2012 22:07:10 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think it makes sense to have a separate toolsmith&apos;s repo for ongoing work where people can keep adding tools. As those tools become stable, they can be rolled back into a hbase-tools module in the main project. This allows for faster iteration on just the tools and an independent release cycle for newer tools that folks might find useful.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13453675" author="stack" created="Wed, 12 Sep 2012 03:34:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;If you want, you could do something like Jesse suggested whereby a non-committer could maintain a &apos;branch&apos; out on github.  The notion is that in the hbase JIRA we&apos;d add a branch that you could file issues against and fix out on github.  That way your github work gets visibility inside in the project, you can iterate at whatever rate you want, and you don&apos;t need to go via committer.  Would that work for hbase-tools that are new not yet part of core?  As tools mature out in hbase-tools, we can bring them over.  If enough of them, we could make hbase-tools module.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
