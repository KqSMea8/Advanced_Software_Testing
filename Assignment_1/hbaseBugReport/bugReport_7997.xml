            <title>[HBASE-7997] One last set of class moves before 0.95 goes out</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-7997</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;hbase-server depends on hbase-client.  Alot of exceptions are in hbase-client that are thrown by the hbase-server.  Should these be in a common place instead of in hbase-client explicitly?  Say in hbase-common?  The client move put all of our exceptions into an exception package (apparently this is my fault).  Is this a good idea?  How many of these exceptions can we put beside the place where they are thrown?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue is about spending a few hours looking at class locations before 0.95 goes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13592811" author="eclark" created="Mon, 4 Mar 2013 23:50:01 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The exceptions were put into hbase-client because some of them depend upon the protobuf classes in hbase-protocol and any exceptions that can possibly make it into the client need to be accessible in hbase-client.  &lt;br/&gt;
They were moved into the .exceptions namespace so that hbase-client doesn&apos;t have a regionserver namespace.  That seemed too weird.  And it makes placement of exceptions pretty easy to understand.  They all go in the same module under the same namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best would be that none of the exceptions depend upon protobuf and they all can go into hbase-common.&lt;br/&gt;
Next best imo would be having them in hbase-client.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Though I could be convinced that the .exception namespace was not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592878" author="ghelmling" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 00:59:54 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not a huge fan of having all exceptions in the same package.  I think in general they make most sense in the packages where they most relate, where you have some context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand why it was done the current way though, and agree that a .regionserver package in the client module would be weird.  Is there some other package where these exceptions would naturally belong though?  Like for AccessDeniedException, I think that fits much more naturally in o.a.h.h.security, whether it&apos;s in hbase-server, hbase-client, or hbase-common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all exceptions that don&apos;t depend on protobuf classes, I think they should be in hbase-common.  Any exceptions that do depend on protobuf bits could stay in hbase-client or get reworked to remove the protobuf bits.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Should it be made less critical, or renamed to &quot;move exception classes to common&quot;, or closed due to lack of activity and people can file specific JIRAs if they want to move classes?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Packages are reaching over into each other &amp;#8211; everything references pb and util packages &amp;#8211; but saw no easy wins other than the unused files it spotlighted.  Going to close this as won&apos;t fix for 0.95.1&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
