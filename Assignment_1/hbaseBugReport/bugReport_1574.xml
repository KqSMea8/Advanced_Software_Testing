                    <description>&lt;p&gt;in 880 there is no way to do a batch delete (anymore?).  We should add one back in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12754809" author="stack" created="Mon, 14 Sep 2009 01:04:51 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Pulling into 0.20.1.  We need it (I won&apos;t up the RPC version when I add the client/server methods since its a pure addition).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12755254" author="stack" created="Mon, 14 Sep 2009 23:48:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Any chance of a review J-D?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a pretty addition.  In particular, the code in HConnectionManager is effectively duplicated.  I tried to make a class to hold common code but it just made stuff worse; state is held in too many variables across the full breadth of the method.  I factored out what I could.  It would help if Put and Delete had an ancestor or even if it was just an interface such as Row with a getRow method in it or ComparableRow.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12755264" author="erikholstad@gmail.com" created="Tue, 15 Sep 2009 00:22:01 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not against having a common base class or interface, like update or so. The reason that we didn&apos;t do that in the first place was the different way that we were using them, for example with buffering and so on, but this might change now when we are doing this multi delete stuff. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12755279" author="stack" created="Tue, 15 Sep 2009 00:55:52 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This is a bit better.  The &quot;common&quot; interface is Row.. things that have a row can implement Row.  Row has a getRow method.  Thats it.  I had RowComparable as the interface but thought it better to leave the two concepts distinct in case we want Row without Comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this patch, the duplication of code is gone.  We instantiate a Batch private utility class to run the batching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J-D (or Holstad), review please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not upping the RPC version  number because I want this to go into 0.20.1 (upping RPC version will make 0.20.0 incompatible with 0.20.1).  I figure its ok because this is straight addtion of new method.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12755524" author="jdcryans" created="Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:05:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;In HRS, why do you copied the code from the delete method instead of calling it in a for()?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In HTable, I think there&apos;s something missing in the comment. &quot;If exception, list will have &quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the refactoring of HCM and that it handles more than Put, that&apos;s the way to go. I think processBatchOfRows should have a new name, my goal when I wrote it was that it be the single method to handle any batches but now it&apos;s different.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12755528" author="stack" created="Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:21:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The batch delete is different from delete, no?  Would be hard to refactor so they shared commonage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, will fix the HTable comment on commit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, processBatchOfRows is not a good name but I don&apos;t want to change it for this commit to 0.20 branch.  I could open new issue for 0.21 where we look at these batch operations &amp;#8211; including batch get &amp;#8211; and figure out better method namings deprecating the old?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing, I was going to change Row to be package private (Any reaction to this new interface?   Do you think Row a good name?  Should it be HasRow or something?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks J-D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St.Ack&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12755602" author="erikholstad@gmail.com" created="Tue, 15 Sep 2009 17:43:04 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Patch looks good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that we might have to rethink the structure of that code as it looks today if we want to support all these batch actions, to make it in a proper way.&lt;br/&gt;
I would be good to know how people are using the batch methods to see what code we share between the different calls. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
