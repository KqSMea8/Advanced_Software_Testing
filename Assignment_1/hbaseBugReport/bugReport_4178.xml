It is possible to restrict the fields that are returned in this document by specifying the 'field' parameter in your request.
For example, to request only the issue key and summary add field=key&field=summary to the URL of your request.
For example:

            <title>[HBASE-4178] Use of Random.nextLong() in HRegionServer.addScanner(...)</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4178</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;ScannerIds are currently assigned by getting a random long. While it would be a rare occurrence that two scanners received the same ids on the same region server the results would seem to be... Bad.&lt;br/&gt;
A client scanner would get results from a different server scanner, and maybe only from some of the region servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safer approach would be using an AtomicLong. We do not have to worry about running of numbers: If we got 10000 scanners per second it&apos;d take &amp;gt; 2.9m years to reach 2^63.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again the same reasoning would imply that this collisions would be happening too rarely to be of concern (assuming a good random number generator). So maybe this is a none-issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AtomicLong would also imply a minor performance hit on multi core machines, as it would force a memory barrier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13081323" author="ghelmling" created="Tue, 9 Aug 2011 00:15:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;What happens if a region server restarts?  Would we be resetting and starting the AtomicLong over again with numbers that were previously handed out?  If so, it&apos;s possible this change would vastly reduce the assignable space effectively used and increase the probability of collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s behavior in the client code that would effectively invalidate the existing scanner in the case of a server restart &amp;#8211; would have to check.  We could also ensure uniqueness (and side-step the counter resetting) by checking the server start code either on the client side or changing scanner id from long to byte[] and prepending the start code with a separator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current random assignment does nicely avoid this potential issue, though.  Yes there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a possibility of collisions.  But is this really an issue that needs fixing?  Personally, I&apos;m open to arguments either way.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Seems like this issue is about what would be a really rare event though. (I guess an experiment to confirm?)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13081448" author="stack" created="Tue, 9 Aug 2011 05:32:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;IIUC, if a regionserver restarted, then it&apos;d start scannerids over at zero again.  Any scanners that had been running against the server when it died will have to go get new ids for the regions they had been scanning over in their new locations (Scanner ids are scoped to a region scan; client sets up new scanner id every time it crosses into new region)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13081908" author="lhofhansl" created="Tue, 9 Aug 2011 20:41:55 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;So in summary an AtomicLong that resets (naturally) when the region server restarts should work, but it is not clear that this is actually a worthwhile problem to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to do the trivial AtomicLong fix, or to just close issue... Leaning towards the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
