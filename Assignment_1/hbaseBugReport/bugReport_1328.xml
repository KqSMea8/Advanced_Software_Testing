            <title>[HBASE-1328] Evangelize HBase in Media</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1328</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We need to spread the word more on HBase to advance adoption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the first step and create a HBase Twitter account that talks about itself as it &quot;sees&quot; itself being mentioned on the intertubes. Here the URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/HBase&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/HBase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should discuss further means of a combines effort given our limited advertisement budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I created the account for Twitter, I suggest we share the details and set the email address to a central account, so that more than one person can post updates. BTW, other projects on Apache.org follow the same approach, so this is more or less a working concept. And avoids someone else hogging the HBase account name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12700512" author="stack" created="Sat, 18 Apr 2009 17:32:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I made this issue &apos;critical&apos;, rather than &apos;major&apos;, since its a means to broader community &amp;#8211; broad community is what hbase needs to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lars also suggested that we work on the home page and on the wiki layout to clean them up and make them more presentable.  In particular, he suggested &amp;#8211; which I liked &amp;#8211; that on the home page that we link to use case, descriptions of how hbase is being used in deployment.  These use cases would include detail and most importantly, why hbase is being used rather than some other tech (Lars also made the point that we shouldn&apos;t be about hbase being only possible soln., just about why it in particular works in the described use case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lars also suggested that we should choose a few stats that we might want to monitor over time as fit criteria for how well we&apos;re doing on this issue such as mentions in blogosphere, numbers on irc channel, mailing list numbers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12700521" author="larsgeorge" created="Sat, 18 Apr 2009 18:34:54 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The only other effort I know of is the &quot;fan of hbase&quot; on facebook. Who created that one? What is its goal? Can we somehow combined efforts or even consolidate them? For example, the Twitter updates could be cross posted to Facebook&apos;s status of the HBase account (if that is actually an account?) using TweetDeck etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just on Stack&apos;s comment, the thing I see is that we need to tackle two audience mainly, the developers and the management. While we are starting to have good documentation on the Wiki for developers I think we could improve to pitch HBase on an &quot;executive white paper&quot; level - so that it will be considered by the decision makers in selection processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have so many &quot;Powered by&quot; entries - there ought to be a lot of material we could use to build case studies. And as Stack says, I think we should not answer the religious question &quot;Why HBase? Why not database A or storage solution B?&quot; - we need to explain why we use it for our particular projects. That alone will show off HBase&apos;s features and how someone could make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also suggesting we create a army of volunteers, the &quot;Ambassadors of HBase&quot;. I am a - self proclaimed, mind you - European Ambassador for HBase where I offer any company or institution to have me present and advise on HBase. Just for the cost of travel (and accommodation if to far away). Not sure if anyone will make use of this, but it is one more step towards advocating HBase to everyone who is even remotely interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is of course selling us through our site. It must answer all preliminary questions a developer or decision maker may ask. Maybe divide the sections into two separate ones, have a generic FAQ, case studies and white paper section and then a developers corner with API documentation, samples, advice etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more issue - and please this is not to blame anyone, you are all outstanding guys - I would suggest to clean up the Javadocs starting with the direct API (or client) classes and then traversing down. That way a new developer has a much better support from say within Eclipse as the documentation of the classes already gets them what they need quick. The lower classes are important too as that will give more people access to the gory details and we may gain more contributors and eventually committers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am off here, please let me know too. I am just trying to get a revolution going. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
