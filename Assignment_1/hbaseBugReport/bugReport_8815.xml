            <title>[HBASE-8815] A replicated cross cluster client</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8815</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to float this idea for brain storming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBase is a strongly consistent system modelled after bigtable which means a machine going down results in loss of availability of around 2 minutes as it stands today. So there is a trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for high availability and redundancy, it is common practice for online/mission critical applications to run replicated clusters. For example, we run replicated clusters at pinterest in different EC2 az(s) and at google, critical data is always replicated across bigtable cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At high volumes, 2 minutes of downtime can also be critical, however, today our client does not make use of the fact, that there is an available slave replica cluster from which slightly inconsistent data can be read. It only reads from one cluster. When you have replication, it is a very common practice for reading from slave if the error rate from master is high. That is how, web sites serve data out of MySQL and survive machine failures by directing their reads to slave machines when the master goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure folks love the strong consistency gaurantee from HBase, but I think that this way, we can make better use of the replica cluster, much in the same way people use MySQL slaves for reads. In case of regions going offline, it would be nice if, for the offline regions only (a small fraction), reads could be directed to the slave cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know one company which follows this model. At Google, a replicated client api is used for reads which is able to farm reads to multiple clusters and also writes to multiple clusters depending on availability in case of Multi master replication.&lt;/p&gt;

A client layer on top of HTable can be made which can do the autoswitching of the peer.. I will look into this more next week and get back. (Have some more open Qs in mind &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
