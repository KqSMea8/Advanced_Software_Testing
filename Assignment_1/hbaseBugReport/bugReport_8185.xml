            <title>[HBASE-8185] Feature to enable Client Side Scanning(Client side merging) in HBase.</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8185</link>
                <project id="12310753" key="HBASE">HBase</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The motivation of this was to enable the client to be able to open the region scanner(and in turn open StoreScanners) and perform the merge on the client side. This will lower the cpu ops that are consumed by the RegionServer since the data is pulled directly from the datanode. In cases where the user is interested to perform a large scan on hbase data check-pointed at a point of time, we think that ClientSideScan(ClientSideMerge) would give a very high throughput as compared to using the ClientScanner in HTable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13611442" author="lhofhansl" created="Fri, 22 Mar 2013 23:46:48 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking along these line myself, i.e. to have a way to tap into HBase merge-sort algorithm, without using the rest of it (where that makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13611496" author="manukranthk" created="Sat, 23 Mar 2013 01:01:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The motivation of this was to enable the client to be able to open the region scanner and perform the merge on the client side. This will lower the cpu ops that are consumed by the RegionServer. In cases where the user is interested to perform a large scan on hbase data check-pointed at a point of time, we think that this would give a very high throughput as compared to using the ClientScanner in HTable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea was to create a ReadOnlyHRegion, but that idea seemed to be too HeavyWeight though it require lesser code change.&lt;br/&gt;
The other way was to create an abstraction of a ReadOnlyStore, and open these read only stores in the client side. This list of stores is used to open a RegionScanner and then used to serve the user through a ResultScanner directly.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13611516" author="enis" created="Sat, 23 Mar 2013 01:35:08 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Related, one idea I was entertaining is to be able to scan from snapshot&apos;s directly and do the client side scanning from mapreduce jobs. Snapshots will also be a good initial target to introduce this, since we would not have to deal with memstore updates. Snapshot will also naturally be read only. &lt;br/&gt;
Full table scans from mapreduce jobs then become, 1. take a lightweight snapshot, 2. scan from MR using local scanners without touching the hbase daemons. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13611526" author="manukranthk" created="Sat, 23 Mar 2013 01:59:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Enis Soztutar, our idea was close to what you&apos;ve mentioned. Creating a snapshot of a store using hdfs hardlinks of the store files and thus use them to create this ReadOnlyStore and leveraging the HBase Scanner Hierarchy to perform the merge. This will allow us to scan the data present in hbase from a map reduce job where the cumulative cpu available from the map reduce cluster is higher than that possible from the hbase cluster&apos;s region servers put together. In cases where the hbase load is write intensive this will help in isolating the write load from the read load.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13611586" author="yuzhihong@gmail.com" created="Sat, 23 Mar 2013 04:29:00 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a snapshot of a store using hdfs hardlinks of the store files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what consistency model you are targeting.&lt;br/&gt;
Would taking the snapshot involve master coordination ?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13613352" author="manukranthk" created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 00:49:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The use case we are trying to solve does not need a fully consistent snapshot of the data. The region flush is optional and we are not currently considering coordinating with the master while performing the flush over the entire table. The snapshot thus produced will be a ragged edge snapshot. Ted Yu, do you see any use cases that will be needing a consistent snapshot?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13613362" author="yuzhihong@gmail.com" created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 01:05:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;In trunk and 0.94 branch, snapshot normally refers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-7290&quot; title=&quot;Online snapshots &quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-7290&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-7290&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: online snapshot where master coordination is involved. An enhancement to be developed is the ability to retrieve records from a point in time snapshot without restoring the full table to that snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the intent of this JIRA better from your description above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
